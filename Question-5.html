    <h2>What is HTML5</h2>
    <p>HTML 4's successor, HTML 5, is a significant improvement over HTML 4. Additionally, HTML5 has stressed its ability to produce multimedia features, including responsiveness and graphics, without the need for an external content player like Adobe Flash Player. </p>

    <h1>Feature of HTML5</h1>
    <h2>Semantic Elements</h2>
    <p>The word "semantic" is used to describe the meaning of the text while creating an HTML script. Simply described, semantics is the use of HTML elements to reflect the material they contain correctly. In contrast to the <b>P</b> tag, which indicates it can be used to hold paragraph information, the <b>Div</b> tag does not indicate the content it will carry. </p>


    <h2>Audio and Video Support</h2>
    <p>Support for music and video is only one of the numerous functionalities offered by HTML 5. It has lessened the inconvenience of utilizing third-party services like Adobe Flash player. Use the <b>Audio</b> and <b>Video</b> tags to insert audio and video into your HTML document, respectively. </p>
    
    <h2>Responsive Images</h2> 
    <p>Previously, you had to use several lines of CSS and occasionally JavaScript to generate flexible images for the web, but HTML 5 streamlines the process by introducing the srcset element, which allows you to specify several versions of an image at different screen resolutions.
